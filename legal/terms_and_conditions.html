        <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Accounts</h2>

        <h3>1.1. Eligibility</h3>

        </p>

        <h3>1.2. Account Creation &amp; Security</h3>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Services may require you to create an account or log in via a third-party
          platform (for example, a game account, Discord, or other services). You agree to provide
          accurate and up-to-date information and to keep your login credentials secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. If you suspect any
          unauthorized use of your account, you should notify us as soon as possible at
          <a href="mailto:info@teamgalaxy.net" style="color: var(--starlight-turquoise); text-decoration: none;">info@teamgalaxy.net</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Community Conduct &amp; Acceptable Use</h2>

        <h3>2.1. Be Respectful</h3>
        <p>
          Our goal is to build a positive, inclusive community. When using any chat, forum, or community
          features, you agree not to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Harass, threaten, or intimidate others.</li>
          <li>Engage in hate speech, discrimination, or abusive behavior.</li>
          <li>Post content that is obscene, illegal, or intentionally harmful.</li>
          <li>Spam, advertise aggressively, or flood chats with repetitive content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Fair Play &amp; In-Game Rules</h3>
        <p>
          Where the Services relate to games or gaming communities, you agree to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the official rules and terms of the game publisher or platform.</li>
          <li>Not use cheats, hacks, exploits, or unauthorized third-party tools.</li>
          <li>Respect other players and not disrupt gameplay experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may, at our discretion, remove, restrict, or suspend access for users who violate these
          rules or damage the community experience.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. Prohibited Uses</h3>
        <p>You agree not to use the Services to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems, accounts, or data.</li>

          <li>Upload malware, viruses, or other harmful code.</li>
          <li>Impersonate any person, brand, or entity without authorization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h3>3.1. Our Content</h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, all logos, graphics, designs, UI elements, text, code, and other
          content related to the Team Galaxy brand (“Galaxy Content”) are owned or licensed by us and
          are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, or create derivative works from Galaxy
          Content without our prior written permission, except as allowed by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2. User-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>
          “User-Generated Content” (“UGC”) includes any content you upload, post, or share via the Services
          (for example, messages, screenshots, suggestions, or media).
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting UGC, you represent that you have the necessary rights to do so and that your content
          does not violate any third-party rights or applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of your UGC, but you grant Team Galaxy a worldwide, non-exclusive,
          royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish,
          translate, display, and distribute such content for the purpose of operating, improving, and
          promoting the Services (for example, showcasing community achievements or highlights).
        </p>

        <h2>4. Purchases, Digital Items &amp; Merchandise</h2>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may offer digital items, in-community perks, or physical merchandise
          (“Items”) through our Services or via linked platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1. General Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prices, availability, and descriptions of Items are subject to change at any time.</li>
          <li>Taxes, fees, and currency conversion charges may apply, depending on your location and payment provider.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for ensuring that your payment details are correct and authorized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2. Digital Items, Right of Withdrawal &amp; Non-Refund Policy (French Law)</h3>
        <p>
          Digital content (such as digital perks, roles, or other virtual benefits) may be delivered
          immediately or within a short processing time once your payment is confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For consumers located in France or the European Union, certain digital content and services
          may fall under exceptions to the standard right of withdrawal, in particular where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The service has been fully performed before the end of any withdrawal period; and</li>
          <li>You have given your express prior consent for performance to begin and acknowledged that
              you will lose your right of withdrawal once the service is fully performed or the digital
              content is supplied.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These principles are derived from the French Consumer Code, notably provisions such as
          <em>article L121-21-8</em> and its successor articles (including
          <em>article L221-28</em> concerning digital content).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because digital items are usually non-returnable and may be consumed instantly, all sales are
          generally <strong>final and non-refundable</strong> once the digital content has been supplied,
          except:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where a refund is required by mandatory French or EU consumer law; or</li>
          <li>Where we explicitly state otherwise in writing for a specific offer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3. No Guarantees of Continuity</h3>
        <p>
          Any digital perks or benefits linked to specific features, games, or platforms may depend
          on third-party services or our ongoing operations. We do not guarantee that any particular
          perk or benefit will remain available forever, and we reserve the right to modify or discontinue
          them as needed (for example, if a game or external API changes).
        </p>

        <h3>4.4. Prices, Currency &amp; VAT (Micro-Entrepreneur – France)</h3>
        <p>
          Where paid Items or services are offered under a French micro-entrepreneur regime, prices are
          generally expressed in EUR (€) and, in that context:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>TVA non applicable, conformément à l’article 293 B du Code général des impôts (CGI).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that, under that regime, invoices are issued without VAT. If your country or situation
          requires specific tax treatment, you remain responsible for any declarations or obligations
          applicable to you.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services may integrate with or link to third-party platforms such as game publishers,
          Discord, payment providers, analytics tools, or external websites. These third parties
          have their own terms and privacy policies, which you should review separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not control and are not responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The availability, accuracy, or content of third-party services.</li>
          <li>Any losses or issues arising from your use of those third-party services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any reference to third-party games, platforms, or brands is for identification purposes only
          and does not imply sponsorship, endorsement, or official partnership unless explicitly stated.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent
          permitted by law, we do not make any promises or warranties about:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of content.</li>
          <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Services.</li>
          <li>Suitability of the Services for any particular purpose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You use the Services at your own discretion and risk. Nothing in these Terms is intended to
          exclude or limit any legal rights that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Team Galaxy and its owners, collaborators,
          and affiliates will not be liable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.</li>
          <li>Any loss of profits, data, reputation, or goodwill.</li>
          <li>Any loss or damage resulting from:
            <ul>
              <li>Your use of or inability to use the Services,</li>
              <li>Any unauthorized access to or use of your account or data,</li>
              <li>Any interruption, suspension, or termination of the Services.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where liability cannot be fully excluded, and to the extent permitted by law, our total aggregate
          liability arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms will be limited to the amount
          you have paid directly to us for the relevant part of the Services in the six (6) months preceding
          the event giving rise to the claim (if any).
        </p>

        <h2>8. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Team Galaxy from and
          against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
          arising out of or related to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your use of the Services;</li>
          <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
          <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our discretion, to suspend or terminate access to the Services (or
          specific features) at any time, including if we reasonably believe that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have violated these Terms or applicable law;</li>
          <li>Your behavior poses a risk to other users or to the integrity of the Services;</li>
          <li>We need to do so to comply with legal obligations or technical constraints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where reasonable, we will try to provide notice, but we are not obligated to offer prior
          notice in urgent situations (for example, severe abuse or security risks).
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to the Services &amp; These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update or modify the Services from time to time (for example, to add or remove
          features, improve performance, or adapt to platform/game changes).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also update these Terms. When we make material changes, we will take reasonable
          steps to inform you, such as updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page or
          providing a notice within the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Services after any update means that you have read and understood
          the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the updated Terms, you should stop using the
          Services.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to them or the Services are governed
          by the laws of <strong>France</strong>, without prejudice to any mandatory consumer protection
          rules that may apply in your country of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before taking any formal action, both you and Team Galaxy agree to first attempt to resolve
          any dispute informally in good faith. If a dispute is not resolved within a reasonable time,
          and unless otherwise required by mandatory law, disputes may be brought before the competent
          French courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in this section removes or limits any rights that you may mandatorily have under
          applicable French or EU consumer law.
        </p>
